# Loop One
Loop One is a Web-based OS environment built with Vanilla Javascript.
Finally putting the code up here on github.
It was built with the intention to let Rookies use it as a base for integrating their apps to a cohesive platform. Their apps could be made on the simple HTML, CSS & Javascript stack.

## About the source code
The source code for this project was never meant to be made public, and it's a total mess. Loop actually started out as a different idea, that of building a full OS emulator on top of Chromium and V8. But then Chrome OS came along, and I pivoted to this rather smallish idea of building a Web-based OS which is helpful for rookies. 

The code is fun to play around with, even through the mess. Also worth noting: much better implementations of this are available now, viz. macintosh.js, which give a much more comprehensive idea of an OS emulator. Basically, don't try to learn anything from this (at least not yet before we clean up the code)!
